# AutomatedPlantFeeder (APF)
Custom PCB design to automatically water a house plant.

### Features
The APF implements three sensors described below:

- Water level detection sensor: monitor water level of the water basin

- Soil moisture sensor: monitor moisture level in the soil so that the plant will be watered if the soil becomes too dry.

- Digital humidity/temperature (DHT) sensor: monitor surrounding humidity and temperature

A button and LCD display allow for user interaction with the APF in the following aspects:

- Adjust the watering amount with a button that cycles through three options: low watering, medium watering, and high watering. The options correspond to the length of time that the motorized water pump is turned on for.

- Print the selected water amount value on the LCD when the button is pressed.

- Print the surrounding humidity and temperature, the current water basin's water level status, and the approximate moisture value in the soil on an LCD.
